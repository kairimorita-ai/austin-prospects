Hi Texas Elite team,

I noticed your business has 406 five-star reviews but no website showing up in Google. That's a missed opportunity—70% of customers search online before calling.

I built this for you as a proof of concept:
[INSERT GITHUB PAGES URL]

It showcases your services, highlights your reviews, and makes it easy for customers to contact you. Modern, mobile-friendly, loads in under 2 seconds.

I also created this ROI breakdown showing how a website + AI assistant can:
• Generate 32% more leads
• Save 12+ hours/week on routine questions
• Pay for itself in 90 days

No cost to you for this POC. If you like it, we can discuss making it live on your own domain and adding features like online booking and AI chat.

Worth a 15-minute call?

Best,
Kairi

P.S. I'm also working with Connor Morita (CC'd), who specializes in helping home service businesses scale with AI and automation.
